# Should use random string? if this  is enabled the proxy id will be like this if server-id is test1: "test1-66cd2aeb-91f3-43a7-a106-e0307b098652"
# or if id is limework-bungee it will be "limework-bungee-66cd2aeb-91f3-43a7-a106-e0307b098652"

# Whether or not RedisBungee should install its version of regular BungeeCord commands.
# Often, the RedisBungee commands are desired, but in some cases someone may wish to
# override the commands using another plugin.
#
# If you are just denying access to the commands, RedisBungee uses the default BungeeCord
# permissions - just deny them and access will be denied.
#
# Please note that with build 787+, most commands overridden by RedisBungee were moved to
# modules, and these must be disabled or overridden yourself.
